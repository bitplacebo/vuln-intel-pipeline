React Server Components versions 19.0.2, 19.1.3 and 19.2.2 are affected, allowing unsafe deserialization of payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints. This can cause an infinite loop that hangs the server process and may prevent future HTTP requests from being served.",

This issue is fixed in versions 7.5.2, 7.4.9, 7.3.14, and 7.2.9. To work around this issue, configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule (e.g., ModSecurity) to block requests containing common XSS payload characters in the ajax query parameter. Alternatively, implement server-side sanitization using middleware to strip or escape dangerous characters from the ajax parameter before it reaches the vulnerable rendering logic.",

Any application using the JSON parser without limits and exposed to untrusted clients is affected. The issue is not a flaw in Express itself, but in configuration. This issue is fixed in version 1.2. To work around, consider adding a limit option to the JSON parser, rate limiting at the application or reverse-proxy level, rejecting unusually large requests before parsing, or using a reverse proxy (such as NGINX) to enforce maximum request body sizes.",
